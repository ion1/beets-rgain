# beets-rgain

An alternative to the [Beets](http://beets.radbox.org/) `replaygain` plugin
that supports more formats (including Vorbis and FLAC). Uses
[rgain](https://bitbucket.org/fk/rgain).

## TODO

* Add a `beet` subcommand.

* Make forcing and the reference level configurable.

* Figure out how to install the helper executable outside the PATH using
  setuptools.

* Contribute the plugin to beets.
